## **üéØ Key Objectives**  
This project focuses on identifying significant predictors affecting Yulu's electric cycle demand and deriving actionable insights through rigorous hypothesis testing.  

### **Steps Taken:**  
1. **Imported and Analyzed Dataset Structure**  
   - Explored data types, dimensions, and missing values.
   - Conducted preliminary descriptive statistics.  

2. **Identified Relationships**  
   - Investigated the correlation between **"Count"** (demand) and other independent variables.  

3. **Tested Key Hypotheses**  
   - **Impact of "Workingday"** on cycle rentals.  
   - Differences in **rental counts** across seasons and weather conditions.  
   - Dependency of **"Weather"** on **"Season"**.  

4. **Statistical Assumptions**  
   - Validated normality and homogeneity of variance.  
   - Proceeded with analysis even when assumptions were not met.  

5. **Hypothesis Testing Process**  
   - Defined null (H‚ÇÄ) and alternative (H‚ÇÅ) hypotheses for each test.  
   - Set a significance level (Œ±).  
   - Conducted statistical tests and calculated relevant statistics.  

6. **Insights Derived**  
   - Made decisions based on statistical significance and provided actionable recommendations.

## **üîç Key Findings**  
- **Seasonal and Weather Influence:** Significant variations in cycle demand were observed across seasons and weather conditions.  
- **Workingday Effect:** Working days showed a notable impact on rental behavior.  
- **Correlation Insights:** Independent variables like temperature and humidity exhibited varying degrees of correlation with cycle demand.  
- **Statistical Assumptions:** While some tests failed normality assumptions (due to large sample size), the results still provided critical directional insights.

- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.  
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.  
  - `scipy.stats` for hypothesis testing.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
